IFJ Project 2014/2015
=======
*University of Technology Brno*

*This shared repository contains complete source code of project of Formal Languages & Automata class from academic year 2014/2015 on Univesity of Technology, Brno.*

## Description

This project is primarily focused on creating a working *pseudo-pascal* compiler/interpretter in language C. By *pseudo-pascal* is meant iteration of language pascal, leaving the syntax, adding few functions (for example qsort()) and removing the user data types to simplify the process of translation.

Chances are that you, the visitor, have found this page as a result of Googling in order to simplify your task in IFJ class on BUT. Feel free to inspire yourself, but be aware that copying even parts of the code may and will result in 0 points and standing infront of disciplinary commision. 

In development we run on scrum iteration (or pseudo-scrum if you will), which ensured that at least some progress is made in time definite intervals.

Makefile is included, simple command `make` will be good enough.

## Authors

This project was designed & programmed by the team of four starting programmers - [Daniel Dušek](https://github.com/dusekdan), [Matúš Bútora](https://github.com/butoramatus), [Roman Jaška](https://github.com/rsn4ke), [Filip Kalous](https://github.com/Strihtrs), in order to complete the Formal Languages & Automata class.

In the process of creation of the code, the team lost one of its programmers (not mentioned among the authors) and half of the work the team did was motivated by unmeassurable hatred against the guy who left without saying a word.

Team managed to recover from the loss of the programmer and complete the task on time, reaching 21.0 points for each of the team members in the end (maximum amount of points per person in 5-man team is 20.0, so it could be considered success).

### Roles

*Despite the fact we were all programmers, we had also some specific roles.*

1. Team leader, ScrumMaster, Daniel Dušek
2. Syntax & Semantic analyser designer, Roman Jaška
3. Precedence table designer, Filip Kalous
4. Interpretter designer, industrial spy, Matúš Bútora
